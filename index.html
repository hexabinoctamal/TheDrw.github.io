        <hr class="my-4">
		I like to do the programmings. I went to school for programmings, but I was just cheating in everything and didn't learn anything. 
		So I decided to leave and work on all the stuff I cheated on on my own. 
		Learning two hard, yo. The languages I kind of know with at least one day of experience are: 
		<ul> 
			<li><strong>C++</strong>,</li> 
			<li><strong>C#</strong> (mainly scripting in the game engine, Unity),</li>
			<li><strong>Java</strong>,</li>
			<li><strong>Python</strong>,</li> 
			<li>and something <strong>else</strong></li> 
		</ul>
		I have a mobile game made with Unity up and ready to go, but since I can't afford a privacy policy, you'll never see it.
		Small challenges on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/TheDrw"><strong>codewars</strong></a> is pretty excitings. 
		You should try it. Well, you don't have to. Actually, you should. Currently, I am learning
		the very unreal, but is very real, unreal engine to figure out stuff. 
		Also, I is trying some rear-end things, er, I mean, back-end things with pythong. 
		I am also working on another game that you'll, also, never see, made in Unity.<br><br>
		
		Streaming is cool, two. I don't strim that much, but when I do, it's usually in twitch land. You should follow it and never look back. 
		I mainly play dumb games like Elder Scrolls Online and Street Fightur. <br><br>
		
		There's also some other social media things like youtube and instagram. You could follow those and never message me. 
		I have a facebook, but I never go on it anymore. Facebook loop too stronk. 
		I only go on the messenger thing. 
		So if I never accept your friend request or respond to your things on there, don't take it personally. 
		Actually, take it personally. You shouldn't have me tell you how to feel. Nevermind, don't take it too personal. <br><br>
		
		This is my current pc: <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/R4zkNN"><strong> T3h Ryzen Monstur. </strong></a> 
		Ryzen 1700 is overclocked at ~3.8 jiggaHurtz at ~1.337v or somethin' and 
		the G.Skill mammaries are at ~2.934 x 10^6 Hz with 14-15-15-35 timings if you wanted to know dat.
